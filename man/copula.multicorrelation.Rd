\title{coupla versions of distance multicorrelation}
\usage{
copula.multicorrelation(x, vec = 1:ncol(x), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a data matrix or a list of doubly centered distance matrices}

\item{vec}{if x is a matrix, then this indicates which columns are treated together as one sample; if x is a list, these are the indexes for which the multivariance is calculated. The default is all columns and all indexes, respectively.}

\item{...}{these are passed to \code{\link{cdms}} (which is only invoked if \code{x} is a matrix)}
}
\description{
Formally it is nothing but distance multicorrelation applied to the Monte Carlo emprical transform of the data. Hence its values vary for repeated runs.
